# mitochondrial-DNA-methylation-analysis
classify_methyl.py
Classified cytosine in reference genome into CpG, CHG, CHH contexts.

estimated methylation.R
The methylation levels were averaged over every 100 base pairs of DNA in unmethylated negative control. 
And the methylation levels were averaged over every 1000 base pairs of DNA in supernatant and precipitate samples.

snp_calling_and_AF.R
The ratio of reads generated from mitochondrial and NUMT were showed by the allele frequency (AF). And the total number of SNPs between mitochondrial and NUMT for every 5 % of allele frequency was presented by histogram
